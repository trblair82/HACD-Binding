Add HACDdylib.java to your Java project.

In your java code load the binding library 
HACDdylib HACDdylib = (HACDdylib)Native.loadLibrary("HACD_JNA_Binding",HACDdylib.class);


Call HACDdylib.JNAConvexDecomposition with a float array(your triangles), an int(number of triangles), and an IntByReference(number of clusters returned from HACD) as arguments to return a Pointer to your HACD clusters.

JNACluster pointer;
             pointer = HACDdylib.JNAConvexDecomposition(primitives, numTris, pcount);

Access your clusters using JNA Pointer.toArray
JNACluster[] clusters = (JNACluster[])pointer.toArray(pcount);
